  \resumeSubHeadingListStart
    \resumeSubheading{Bot Lab LP (Schonfeld external fund)}{New York, NY}
    {Quantitative Trader}{April 2019 - Present}
    \resumeItemListStart
    \resumeItem{Overview} {Built a $\sim$ daily frequency US Equities statistical arbitrage strategy alongside a Citadel quant portfolio manager (main pm) and Stanford CS PhD (Infra Engineer) exclusive to
      Schonfeld Strategic Advisors. Managed three additional employees with a 100MM's initial allocation.}
    \resumeItem{Research/ Strategy}
               { \\$\bullet$ \textbf{Alpha} - Design and analysis of forecasts across 5 thematic buckets: Market Data, Fundamental, Sentiment, Microstructure, and
                 Cross Asset. Lead the development of three of our eight main signals. Helped maintain, update, and retrain the full suite of
                 sub-signals as well as their formulation into a master signal as needed. In sample correlation with the one day forward return of 3\%, out of sample,
                 2\%, and in Live 2.5\%.

                 High level areas of research: Changes to the response (forward return residualized to usfast, changing frequencies/ multiperiod models), applications of statistical learning techniques to
                 individual alphas as well as alpha combination, evaluating potential new alpha datasets.
                 \\$\bullet$ \textbf{Portfolio Construction} - Encoded linear constraints (bounded industry/style factor exposure, locates, trading limits, position limits, gmv utilization, etc), quadratic
                 constraints (risk, plus many experiments requiring semidefinite programming), and the objective in MOSEK. Started with a minimal working optimizer and added in complexity/ awareness with time (and
                 substantial backtesting!). For example went from a simple but sufficient quarter spread cost
                 assumption to a tuned, stock dependant, cost with impact estimate model. Trained additional factors to add into risk model, tested through back test, and deployed as needed/ requested by
                 investors. Eg, stay at home vs covid recovery factor, election factors, China exposures related factors, Ukraine/ Russia factors. Assisted in implementing and running our backtesting framework.
                 Achieved a consistent 90-95\% idio risk portfolio (to USFAST).
                 %% \\$\bullet$ \textbf{CBOE Options Example} - Performed initial analysis of the CBOE trial data set in R. Upon determining that data set was worth
                 %% incorporating into our signals I wrote the file ingestion, parsing, and cleaning code in python, then calculated contract level statistics including, greeks,
                 %% implied vol, implied price, open interest, volumes, etc. From there I wrote the aggregation functions into symbol level statistics (features) that our alpha would use and fit on.
                 %% Regressing the Options signal on the master signal (vs other signals) this sub alpha accounts for roughly 20$\%$ of our overall predictive power. This is a
                 %% decently outsized contribution given there are $\sim$10 signals overall.
                 \\$\bullet$ \textbf{Trading} -\\
                 Operational: worked with our infrastructure engineer to implement our live trading interface.
                 Traded over 12 billion USD via 4 execution brokers over the last 3 years across $\sim$ 4000 unique publically traded US Equities. As the firm's
                 quant trader I had final sign off responsibility to review and submit all trading baskets Bot Lab was sending to the execution brokers via Schonfeld's OMS (JSON interface to fix).

                 Research: I developed models to anlayze and determine: allocation amongst brokers, allocation amongst trading algos,
                 static schedule logic (trade windows, algo instructions, auction participations), etc.
                 Additionaly reviewed execution performance with brokers (and Schonfeld) quarterly and incorporated findings into internal work/ trading decisions.

                  Generation Platform (Lightspeed), and diagnostic tools (Fusion - advanced UI
                  charting tool). Supported Production Modules and operations team in running
                  live/ production issues. Supported Researchers' various use cases and implementations of logic into the platform.
