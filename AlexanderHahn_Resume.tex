\section{\sl\bf Experience\\}


\begin{ncolumn}{2}

{\it Nomura Securities International, Tech Analyst} & ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~August '14 - August '16
\end{ncolumn}\\
New York, NY\\
Recently finished the third leg of a 1.5 year long automation project.
Phase I automated the Nomura America's Fixed Income OTC Derivatives trading
desk front to back flow. From pricing/ valuation functions, Cash and
Settlement processes, to record keeping and financial ledger postings, I was a tech
analyst working alongside numerous areas of the firm. Phase II focused on Nomura America's Equity OTC
Derivatives trade flow. With the completion of the first phase and team
re-orgs I was promoted to be the lead tech analyst of the project and managed the entire project through the SDLC project framework. Similar to phase I I worked with the full spectrum
of the firm, from the derivative quants, traders, Risk, Ops, Product
Controllers, to a multitude of tech teams. Some more common tasks included
investigating and updating pricing and valuation models, constructing xml messages and file feeds, creating
test scripts/ harnesses, Oracle SQL table design, and other FOBO automations
for full STP. The completion of NHA Derivatives Phase I\&II
automation helped Nomura increase operational efficiency and reduce/ refactor
headcount. Phase III focused more on automating complex exotic notes and
bonds, hedged with various derivative swap models to create custom tailored
financial products for clients.\\

\begin{ncolumn}{2}
{\it Cornell Mathematics Department, Teaching Assistant} & ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~August '13 - May '14
\end{ncolumn}\\
Cornell, Ithaca NY\\
Two years math center teaching experience with over 100 undergraduates. The majority came for Calculus 1 \& 2, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Differential Equations. As per my concentration in mathematical physics/scientific computing I was allocated more towards the physics undergrads and their relevant courses: ODE and PDE solver techniques, linear algebra, Lie Theory, and Matrix computation algorithms (Numerical Methods). Furthermore, I TA'ed a mechanics 101 course and assisted in laser cavity cooling research during the summer of 2013 through Cornell at The University of Shanghai for Science and Technology.
